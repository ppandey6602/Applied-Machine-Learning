# Applied-Machine-Learning
Contains Codes for the basic concepts of NLP, Speech Recognition and other important concepts in the field of Machine Learning.

For the dataset refer the links given below:

1.) Twitter Sentiment Analysis:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140
(Don't forget to change the name of dataset in the code).

2.) Speech Recognition:
      i) Reading and plotting audio signals. 
         (Try using diffrent audios given in the folder itself)
         
      ii) Generating audio signal from custom parameters
          (Try Changing the tone frequency and parameters to get a different amplitude vs time curves)
          
      iii) Sythesizing music from given custom parameters
           (We can try experimenting the music produced by changing frequencies and types of tones of json file.)
